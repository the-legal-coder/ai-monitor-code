**What is Generative Engine Optimization?**

The way we search for information has fundamentally changed with the emergence of large language models (LLMs). As users begin to rely on tools like ChatGPT instead of traditional search engines such as Google, digital marketers must adapt to ensure their brands are effectively represented across various LLM-powered platforms.

**Definition of GEO**

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the process of enhancing content for LLM-powered AI search engines like ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google AI Overview, and Perplexity AI, among others. Since this is an evolving field, there is currently no consensus on a specific term to describe the process of optimizing content for these platforms.

I propose the term Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) for the practice of influencing LLM-driven generative searches in a way that benefits a particular brand or product.

Ultimately, I will leave it to the industry to decide whether they prefer GEO or AEO.

This term was coined by me, Avinash Tripathi. I am also the founder of a startup called AI Monitor. For more details, please visit my blog at https://getaimonitor.com/blogs/what-is-geo-llm-seo-ai-seo.html.
